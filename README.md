# skizzenbuch

an uncommented, unorder, and sporadic collection of sketches.

this collection of sketches is mostly derived from conversations I had with colleagues, friends, and students. some sketches are quite banal while others are small coherent applications.

see the [blog](https://dennisppaul.github.io/skizzenbuch/) for more information on some of the sketches.
